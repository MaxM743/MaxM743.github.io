      <h1>Mandelbrot Set</h1>
      <h2>History</h2>
      <p>The Mandelbrot set is a famous and visually captivating mathematical set that arises from the iteration of a simple mathematical formula. It was named after its discoverer, Benoit B. Mandelbrot, who was a mathematician and pioneer in the field of fractal geometry. The Mandelbrot set is not only a fascinating mathematical object but also a prime example of a fractal, which is a complex geometric shape that exhibits self-similarity at different scales.</p>
      <h2>Mathematical Definition</h2>
      <p>The mandelbrot set is define in the complex plane $\mathbb{C}$ as the set of complex numbers $c$ for which the following sequence converge:</p> 
      
      $$
      \left\{
      \begin{align}
      z_{n+1}&=z_{n}^2+c\\
      z_{0}&=0
      \end{align}
      \right.
      $$
      <p>The mandelbrot set is basically confined to the region $[-2, 1]\times [-1.5, 1.5]\subset\mathbb{C}^2$. To construct the mandelbrot set, we iterate through the previous intervals and by computing the sequence for each points we decide either it converges or not after a certain number of iterations. If the sequence diverges, we color the point in the complex plane according to the number of iterations it took to diverge.</p>
